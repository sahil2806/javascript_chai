API --> 1> rest full API (representation state transfer)( resource oriented)
    Every real life entity is expected to be represented as a resource.
    Every time with restfull api request. we have to sent  the method of the request.
    urls
    In rest convention  data/ messages sent apart from url are sent in json
    get,post ,put,patch,delete;

    -->HTML only support get and post method.
    Get --> retrieve info about the resource.
    Post --> create side effect
    Put --> Make complete update
    Patch --> make partial update to the reource.
    Delete --> delete a resource.

    Differernce between get and post
    --> In get method data is send in url  that means it get saved in history while in post methos data is not sent in url rather than request body / payload.

    3 way
    -->(1) request param  //  ex--> /movie/blackpanther
    -->(2) Query param    // ex--> /category/electronics? comapany==samsung , order==desc && filter==price
    -->(3) Request body  



    
2) grpc  (action oriented)
gRPC stands for Remote Procedure Calls. It is an open-source, cross-platform 
framework for high-performance remote procedure calls (RPCs). Google originally 
developed gRPC as an internal RPC framework, but it became open source in 2015.
